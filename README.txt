0utZer0 (originally named 0zero-godot)
====================================
A game that was originally going to be 0zero, but ended up
being unfinished because of time constraints and developer crunch.

I made this project because I was interested in 3D game development
instead of 2D-ish (like the original counterpart, which is written in LibGDX).

The original project can be found here: https://github.com/Iyxan23/0zero
===================================
If you want to test it out, use Godot 3.5.2 to make sure anything works out.
